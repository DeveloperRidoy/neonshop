            We will not be liable if for any reason our site is unavailable at

            PRICING POLICY
          </h3>
          <p>Prices shown on the Site are in United States Dollars (USD).</p>
          <p>
            Prices are subject to change effective immediately upon posting to
            our site or other form of notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we take care to ensure that all prices quoted on our site are
            accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of
            any product you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible
            and give you the option of reconfirming the order at the correct
            price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, the order
            will be treated as cancelled and if you have already paid for the
            product you will receive a full refund. We are under no obligation
            to sell the product to you at the incorrect (lower) price (even
            after we have sent you an order confirmation) if the pricing error
            is an obvious typographical or arithmetical inaccuracy and could
            have reasonably been recognised by you as such.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5 uppercase font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl">
            ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR ORDER
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you
            will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This
            email is not an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that
            we have received it. Unless you cancel your order prior to dispatch
            by us, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract
            between you and us is subject to acceptance by us and will be
            completed when we email you to confirm the goods have been
            dispatched and have been handed over to the designated carrier. The
            sale contract is therefore concluded in Victoria, Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
            We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event that we
            are unable to obtain authorization for payment, that the item
            ordered is out of stock, or that you do not meet the eligibility
            criteria set out, or otherwise contemplated, within these terms of
            use or our site. We reserve the right to refuse to process or refuse
            service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion.

            By placing an order through our site, you warrant that you are at
            least 18 years old and are legally capable of entering into binding
            contracts.

            Whilst we will make our best efforts to always process all the
            orders, there may be exceptional circumstances which mean that we
            may need to refuse to process an order after we have sent you an
            order confirmation, which we reserve the right to do at any time, at
            our sole discretion.

            for refusing to process or accept an order after we have sent you
